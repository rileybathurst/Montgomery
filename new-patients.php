<h2>Day One Expectations</h2>
<p>From the initiation of your care, Pacrav Physical Therapy aims to provide a personalized health care experience.  The patient will treated by a highly skilled physical therapy the entire time; Pacrav Physical Therapy does not use any physical therapy aids or assistants.</p>

<p>Day one starts with the completion of the introductory forms.  Because we value your time, Pacrav Physical Therapy has provided this forms electronically to be completed at home prior to the visit.  If one is not comfortable with this process, the patient should arrive 15 minutes before the scheduled time in order to allow for adequate completion time.</p>

<p>The next step is then to begin evaluation process.  This begins with a patient interview where together, the patient and Matthew, will identify the primary goal(s) or reason(s) for seeking physical therapy treatment.  The conversation will continue by targeting important information including but not limited to: your symptoms, the activities you have difficulty with, and your symptom history.  This will allow us to formulate a number of working hypotheses that will drive our physical examination.  The physical examination focuses on tests of functional activities, passive movements of you limbs, strength testing, and the use of touch on the affected areas to fully identify one's restrictions.</p>

<p>Finally, Matthew will discuss his findings and describe the plan of care.  Day one will then conclude ideally with providing some form of <a href="http://localhost:8888/pacrav/services/">treatment</a> and the patient will be prescribed individualized activities to completed at home in order to augment the clinical treatment.   Follow visits will be scheduled that could range from 30-60 minutes depending on the severity and the complexity of the condition.</p>
